# Ultimate-TicTacToe
Hackbright Prep (Jan 2020) Project

Ultimate TicTacToe is a game I made that is just like normal TicTacToe. The only difference is, you can play with a dynamic board! You can choose to play the basic 3X3 board, or you can play the Ultimate way with a 10X10 board! 

This game can be played with a friend, or by yourself. If you are too lazy to download the code, or just want to practice it, I would recommend playing it in [Repl.it] (https://repl.it/~). 

Here is what it looks like in the terminal:

Thanks for checking the game out and GoodLuck !
